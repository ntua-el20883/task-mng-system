Great job setting up the folder structure! Let's start by focusing on the **`MainView.java`** class. This class will be the main entry point for the GUI and will set up the primary layout, navigation, and structure of the application. 

### Why Start with `MainView.java`?

1. **Foundation for Other Views**: `MainView.java` will establish the basic layout of the application and act as a “home” screen that directs users to the other views (Task Management, Category Management, etc.).
2. **Container for Navigation**: It will contain navigation controls (like buttons or menu items) to switch between different management views, allowing us to set up the primary user flow.
3. **Central Window Setup**: We can define the main layout here, including dividing the window into the required sections or cells for displaying information and controls.

After setting up `MainView.java`, we can then move on to implementing each specific view class (`TaskManagementView.java`, `CategoryManagementView.java`, etc.).

### Plan for `MainView.java`

- **Primary Layout**: Divide the main window into the sections specified in your project instructions.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Add buttons for each management view (Tasks, Categories, Priorities, Reminders) to enable navigation.
- **Top Section for Summary Cells**: Show key information, like the total number of tasks, completed tasks, etc.
- **Event Handling**: Add basic event handling for navigation buttons to open each respective management view.

### Components Folder (`components`)

The `components` folder will house **reusable GUI components**. Here are some components you might consider:

1. **Custom Button Component**: 
   - A custom button class, perhaps with styling or icons, which can be used across multiple views for consistency.
   - Example: `CustomButton.java`.

2. **Summary Cell Component**:
   - A cell component for displaying summary information, such as the number of tasks in each status.
   - This could be a simple panel with a title and a value, like `SummaryCell.java`.

3. **Form Components** (Optional):
   - If you need specific input fields or forms for creating/editing tasks, categories, etc., you could create components for input validation, dropdowns, etc.

Starting with these components isn’t strictly necessary at this stage, but they’ll come in handy once we start building out specific functionality in each management view.

### Suggested Order of Implementation

1. **Implement `MainView.java`**: Set up the main layout, navigation, and placeholders for summary cells.
2. **Define Basic Components (if needed)**: If you find yourself repeating elements like buttons or cells in `MainView.java`, we can create these in the `components` folder.
3. **Proceed to Management Views**: After `MainView.java` is complete, we can move on to `TaskManagementView.java` and the others.

Let me know if this approach sounds good to you, and once confirmed, I’ll provide the code for `MainView.java` to get things started!
