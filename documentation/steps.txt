### **Project Structure Recommendations**

1. **Create Packages**:
   - `model`: For entities (Task, Category, Reminder, Priority).
   - `storage`: For JSON handling classes.
   - `view`: For JavaFX GUI classes.
   - `controller`: For classes that handle the logic between the model and view.

2. **Add JSON Library to lib Folder**:
   - Add a library like **Jackson or Gson** for JSON handling. You can reference it in `settings.json`.

3. **Expand `App.java`**:
   - This class will likely serve as the entry point and should handle initializing the GUI and loading initial data from JSON files.

4. **Implement Classes for Each Entity**:
   - Each entity should be a class (e.g., `Task`, `Category`) with methods for manipulating data in memory.
  
5. **Add JSON File Reading/Writing Logic**:
   - Classes to read from and write to JSON should handle specific files, with methods to save all data when the app closes.
